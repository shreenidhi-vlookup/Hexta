# Shared-Host Infra Scaffold — Setup

Run once per fresh EC2 instance, in this order.

## 1. Base system prep

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose-plugin
# NOTE: do NOT install system nginx. We run nginx in Docker instead —
# installing both would double-install and conflict on the listener ports.

# 2GB swap as an OOM-killer safety net (not a performance fix)
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

## 2. Bring up shared infra (Postgres + Nginx) — do this before any project

```bash
cd infra/shared
cp .env.example .env   # set POSTGRES_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps       # confirm both containers healthy
```

Each project adds its own `postgres/init/NN_projectname.sql` file here
(creates its own database inside the one shared Postgres instance)
and its own `nginx/conf.d/projectname.conf` (one server block).

## 3. Install this project's on-demand backend

```bash
sudo cp infra/systemd/hexa-backend.socket   /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp infra/systemd/hexa-backend.service  /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp infra/systemd/hexa-backend-idle.timer   /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp infra/systemd/hexa-backend-idle.service /etc/systemd/system/

chmod +x infra/scripts/idle_stop_watcher.sh
chmod +x infra/scripts/run_ingestion.sh

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now hexa-backend.socket
sudo systemctl enable --now hexa-backend-idle.timer
```

The backend process does **not** start yet — it starts on the first
real request to port 8001, and stops again after 10 idle minutes.
Verify:

```bash
sudo systemctl status hexa-backend.socket    # active (listening)
sudo systemctl status hexa-backend.service    # inactive (dead) until first request
curl http://127.0.0.1:8001/health
sudo systemctl status hexa-backend.service    # now active (running)
```

## 4. Set a billing alarm (do this before onboarding real traffic)

AWS Console → CloudWatch → Alarms → Create Alarm → Billing →
`Total Estimated Charge > $0`. This is the cheapest insurance you'll
ever set up on a multi-project free-tier box.

## 5. Repeat steps 3 for each additional project

Each new project gets:
- Its own `<project>.socket` / `<project>.service` pair, on its own port
- Its own idle-timeout timer
- Its own `nginx/conf.d/<project>.conf`
- Its own database inside the **one** shared Postgres instance
- Its own `run_ingestion.sh`-style batch script if it needs NLP/document processing

No project should ever run its own Postgres, Redis, or vector DB container.
