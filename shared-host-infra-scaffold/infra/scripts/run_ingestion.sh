# Runs the document ingestion pipeline (OCR, chunking, entity
# extraction, embedding generation, indexing) as a one-shot batch job.
#
# This deliberately does NOT run inside the FastAPI process. The
# embedding model is the heaviest component in the stack —
# loading it into the always-on API process means paying that RAM
# cost 24/7 even when nobody is uploading documents. Running it
# here means the memory is only held for the duration of the job.
#
# Trigger this manually, via cron, or via a lightweight upload-queue
# consumer — never call it from inside app.main directly.
