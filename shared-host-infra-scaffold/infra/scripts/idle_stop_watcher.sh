# Systemd socket activation starts hexa-backend.service on the
# first connection, but does NOT stop it again automatically. This
# script is run periodically (via hexa-backend-idle.timer) to
# check for active connections and stop the service if it's been
# idle for longer than IDLE_MINUTES.
#
# This, combined with socket activation, is what lets multiple
# projects share 1 GiB RAM: only the projects actually receiving
# traffic hold memory at any given moment.
#
# Idle tracking uses a timestamp file that records when the last
# active connection was detected. This avoids the pitfall of using
# ActiveEnterTimestamp (service start time) as a proxy for last
# activity.
