"""Multi-question / multi-intent detection and decomposition.

Deterministic splitting of a single user message into independent
information needs, with an *over-split guard* so joint noun phrases like
``income and employment requirements`` stay as ONE question.

Splitting rules
---------------
- Hard boundaries (``?``, ``!``, ``;``, newline) always split.
- A comma splits ONLY when the following fragment looks like an
  independent clause (starts with a question word / auxiliary verb /
  info-request verb, or ends with ``?``). Commas inside numbers are
  protected.
- A conjunction (``and``/``also``/``plus``/``or``/``additionally``)
  splits ONLY when the fragment after it is an independent clause.
  Otherwise it's treated as a list continuation and merged back.

Fragments that collapse to noise words (``help``, ``please`` ...) are
dropped, and leading connectives (``and also tell me``) are stripped.
