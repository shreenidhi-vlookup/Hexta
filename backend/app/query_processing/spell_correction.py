"""Vocabulary-gated typo correction.

Strategy: correct a *single token* only when it is NOT already a known
term/acronym/common word AND it has a strong fuzzy match in the domain
vocabulary. Everything else is left untouched:

- numbers, percentages, dollar amounts are never corrected
- known acronyms (ltv, dti, fha, va, usda, apr ...) are protected
- unknown words with no near match are left as-is (the search engine is
  still typo-tolerant via tsvector stemming and vector similarity)

A small "glued word" recovery pass fixes tokens like ``whatis`` or
``creditscore`` by splitting them into two known vocabulary words.

``rapidfuzz`` is a small, C-accelerated, actively-maintained library —
far lighter than SymSpell or any model, and fast enough for query-time
use on a shared micro instance.
