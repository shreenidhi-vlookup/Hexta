"""Query processing pipeline.

``process_query(raw) -> QueryPlan`` is a pure function (no DB, no I/O)
that turns a raw user message into one or more structured sub-queries:

    raw -> normalize -> multi-question split
        -> per sub-query: spell-correct -> entity extraction
                         -> intent -> expansion

Everything here is deterministic and dependency-free (rapidfuzz aside),
so it is cheap to run at query time on the shared host and trivial to
unit-test.
