"""Response validation — redundant safety-net check (CLAUDE.md rule #1).

The PRIMARY enforcement is in search/hybrid_orchestrator.py WHERE clause.
This module re-checks permissions and version flags as a safety net.

Confidence-based routing is handled by
``response/confidence_thresholds.py`` (``route_by_confidence``) — it sets
``package.routing`` to ``"answer"``, ``"partial"``, or ``"no_answer"``;
validation must NOT treat low confidence as a hard failure, otherwise
every "no answer found" query returns HTTP 500 instead of a graceful
``no_answer`` response.
